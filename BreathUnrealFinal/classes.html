                Breakthrough breathwork is an incredibly powerful experience.
                 One hour of guided breathwork which will put you into an altered 
                 state of consciousness. The thinking mind goes offline and the 
                 subconscious mind comes online. When our mind is constantly 
                 thinking we never get the opportunity to deal with the emotions 
                 we have buried deep down. We try to think ourselves out of these 
                 emotions, change the narrative in our mind, but the emotions are 
                 still stored away. During this breakthrough, we get to feel, 
                 express and release the emotions we are holding onto so that we 
                 don't have to carry them around with us anymore. People report 
                 having outer body experiences, psychedelic experiences and healing
                  experiences all because of the power of the breath.

                <h3>Breathing Retraining Programme</h3>
                <p>
                    We all want to breathe a bit easier. However, the stressful world we live in 
                    speeds up our breathing which has negative impacts on all of our physical and 
                    mental wellbeing. The goal of this programme is to regain control over our day 
                    to day, functional breathing. You will learn to breathe low, breathe less and breathe slow. Learning to breathe correctly can:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improve Sleep</li>		
                        <li>Increase Energy</li>
                        <li>Reduce Stress</li>
                        <li>Enhance Athletic Performance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    The programme consists of a series of simple breathwork techniques and breath holds that you can practice every day and log in your 
                    'Breathing Retraining Programme' booklet which will be given to you should you sign up for the programme.
